# Blackjack (21) Game

Using the deck of cards API I will create a version of the game BlackJack a.k.a 21. The object of the game is to get to 21 and/or as close to 21 to win, anything over 21 you lose. Cards are dealt at random and either Player can win or draw.  

How to play:
Click on deal to generate a card for player 1 and the computer. Hitting deal again will generate the next card for a "Hit Me". Player will continue until someone wins.
